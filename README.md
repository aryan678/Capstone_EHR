# HealthCare Using Ethereum Blockchain

## Project Objective
This project aims to leverage blockchain technology for storing patient healthcare records in a decentralized application (DApp). The DApp is designed with a patient-centric approach, granting patients control over their data. Users are categorized as Owner, Hospitals, Insurance Company, Doctor, and Patient.

Patients have the authority to grant or revoke data access permissions to any doctor. Additionally, patients can upload files such as reports and X-rays to their profiles using IPFS for storage. These files serve as valuable resources for doctors with granted access, enabling them to review patient information for accurate treatment. Patients also have the ability to access their past consultation records.

For doctors, the system provides the capability to view patient records for whom they have been granted access. Doctors can access patient files and review previous consultations, allowing them to offer tailored consultations and treatments based on the available information.
